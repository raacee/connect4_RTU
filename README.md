# User manual

To use the software, the user must first choose the mode he or she wants to play between the two that are available : vs CPU or vs another player. He can also leave the game. The user must press the corresponding key on the keyboard.

Then the user(s) should make a move by selecting the wished column using the arrow keys. Then pressing Enter or Return confirms their choice. This keeps on when "vs Player'' mode is chosen. In the case the user chooses to play against the CPU, the player will choose a column, wait for the computer to make a move, then will be allowed to play again.

Pressing P allows the user to pause the game and pressing again allows it to resume. Pressing Q in the pause menu allows the user to get back to the main menu.

When the game ends, the user is brought back to the main menu, and the user has the choice to go into another game or press Q to leave the game.
